# Traffic Sign Assistant for Visually Impaired

### Abstract

In todayâ€™s world, visually impaired individuals face significant challenges, especially when navigating urban environments and crossing roads. Our project, **Traffic Sign Assistant (TSA)**, addresses these challenges by leveraging advancements in assistive technology. The TSA enhances mobility and safety for visually impaired pedestrians by providing real-time recognition of traffic signs and delivering auditory feedback.

By empowering individuals with visual impairments, this tool facilitates independent navigation and lays the groundwork for further innovation in inclusive mobility solutions.

### Features

- **Real-time Traffic Sign Detection:** Utilizes advanced computer vision techniques (YOLO) to detect traffic signs from live camera feeds.
- **Classification of Traffic Signs:** A CNN-based model classifies recognized traffic signs.
- **Auditory Feedback:** Information about detected signs is communicated to the user via audio, ensuring a seamless, user-friendly experience.
